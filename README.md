# Sustainability Project Chatbot

A conversational AI chatbot built using a LLM called CLAUDE, is designed to answer sustainability-related queries. This bot can answer questions and provide recommendations based on user input. 
To run the chatbot, write python app.py in the terminal in VS Code then click the URL.
Once the server runs, open your web browser and go to the URL provided in the terminal output (usually something like http://127.0.0.1:5000 or http://localhost:5000).
You should now be able to use the chatbot on the web interface.
